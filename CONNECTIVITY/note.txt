the 4:3:end  columns are  Oxy data from ch 1 to ....  ch max channel number
the 5:3:end  columns are  deOxy data from ch 1 to ....  ch max channel number
the 6:3:end  columns are  total data, useless

cleanData is Xian's global component removed data

xyz{i} is the MNI coordinate for subject i


there are two file, simialr data, only using different caps with different channel number.
